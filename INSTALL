INSTALLATION GUIDE
==================

Dependencies
------------

	- GLEW (http://glew.sf.net)
	- GLFW (http://glfw.sf.net)
	- Cython (http://cython.org)
	- Cython-Box2D (http://bitbucket.org/timostolz/gamephysics/)

The first three are packaged in most Linux distributions.  To install them in Debian/Ubuntu:

	sudo apt-get install libglew-dev libglfw-dev cython


Building the Cython-Box2D game physics library
----------------------------------------------

Note: this includes a modified version of Box2D, so you don't need to install Box2D.

Currently (Nov. 11, 2009) our branch of Cython-Box2D, which adds some utility functions, is required to run OpenMelee:

	hg clone http://bitbucket.org/timostolz/gamephysics/ cybox2d
	cd cybox2d
	hg update -C zzzzrrr
	python setup.py build_ext -i

Move the resulting physics.so (or .dll) file to the OpenMelee folder.

Install the p2y.pyd module from poly2tri project, and place it in the utils dir:
http://code.google.com/p/poly2tri/

Building OpenMelee
------------------

Build engine.so (or .dll), which contains the C/C++/Cython parts of the game:

	python setup.py build_ext -i
